### I'm Jo Waters and I am a big fan of using Python to explore data!

In completing my Data Analyst bootcamp with Code Academy I completed capstone analyses and presentations in [Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors](https://github.com/joeaguas/Cardiovascular-Disease-RF-Analysis) and [Historic Tour de France Stages](https://github.com/joeaguas/Historic-Tour-de-France-Analysis). Some of my other favorite projects were looking at the [Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/joeaguas/R-Project) and [Pokemon API](https://github.com/joeaguas/APIs-Assignment). 
I am always excited to learn more about using Python and SQL to create efficient and creative solutions.
